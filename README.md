# SUDOKU SOLVER
## Steps to a Sudoku puzzle
To solve a Sudoku puzzle in Python using the backtracking method, the approach you outlined can be customized with the following steps:

**1. Set up the Puzzle**
The puzzle is a 9x9 grid (M = 9) where we need to fill in the missing numbers (represented as 0s) without violating Sudoku rules.
**2. Utility Functions**
We will need functions to print the Sudoku grid, check whether a number can be placed in a certain position safely, and solve the puzzle using recursion and backtracking.
**3. Check Safety**
A function will check if placing a number in a specific row, column, or 3x3 grid is valid according to Sudoku rules.
**4. Backtracking**
This will be the main algorithm that tries to solve the puzzle by making guesses and then backtracking if those guesses lead to an invalid solution.
